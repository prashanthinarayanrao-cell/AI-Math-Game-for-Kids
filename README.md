# üßÆ AI Math Game for Kids  
*An Interactive, Grade-Adaptive, AI-Powered Learning Game Designed with Instructional Design Methodology*

---

## Project Overview

The **AI Math Game for Kids** is an educational web-based simulation designed to teach foundational math skills (Grades 1‚Äì5) through **AI-generated questions**, **gamified feedback**, and **colorful interactive visuals**.

This project demonstrates how **AI**, **instructional design**, and **child-friendly UX principles** can blend to create engaging, effective learning environments.

## Key Features

 **AI-Assisted Question Generation** ‚Äì Automatically generates math questions per grade level (Grades 1‚Äì5).  
 **Real-Time Feedback** ‚Äì Uses positive reinforcement and stepwise hints for incorrect answers.  
 **Gamification Elements** ‚Äì Multicolored shiny stars, score tracking, and motivational text.  
 **Child-Friendly UX** ‚Äì Playful fonts, bright colors, and animated buttons.  
 **Grade Progression System** ‚Äì ‚ÄúNext Grade Challenge‚Äù encourages continual growth.  
 **Behavioral Reinforcement** ‚Äì Encourages retrying and celebrates effort, not just accuracy.

##  How to Reproduce the Game with AI Tools

> **Prompt to Recreate This Project:**
> 
> ‚ÄúCreate a colorful, child-friendly interactive math game for kids. Include grade-wise questions, ‚ÄòAm I Right?‚Äô button, shiny multicolored stars for correct answers, and a ‚ÄòNext Grade Challenge‚Äô button. The interface must follow gamified instructional design principles (constructivism, formative assessment, behaviorist reinforcement) and use bright, accessible visuals, rounded corners, and motivational text feedback. Include score and timer functionality with responsive design.‚Äù

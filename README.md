#  AI Math Game for Kids  
*An Interactive, Grade-Adaptive, AI-Powered Learning Game Designed with Instructional Design Methodology*

---

## Project Overview

The **AI Math Game for Kids** is an educational web-based simulation designed to teach foundational math skills (Grades 1–5) through **AI-generated questions**, **gamified feedback**, and **colorful interactive visuals**.

This project demonstrates how **AI**, **instructional design**, and **child-friendly UX principles** can blend to create engaging, effective learning environments.

## Key Features

 **AI-Assisted Question Generation** – Automatically generates math questions per grade level (Grades 1–5).  
 **Real-Time Feedback** – Uses positive reinforcement and stepwise hints for incorrect answers.  
 **Gamification Elements** – Multicolored shiny stars, score tracking, and motivational text.  
 **Child-Friendly UX** – Playful fonts, bright colors, and animated buttons.  
 **Grade Progression System** – “Next Grade Challenge” encourages continual growth.  
 **Behavioral Reinforcement** – Encourages retrying and celebrates effort, not just accuracy.

##  Instructional Design Methodologies Used

| **Framework** | **Purpose** | **Application in Project** |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| **ADDIE Model** | Structured design and evaluation process | Guided design from analysis to implementation |
| **Gagné’s Nine Events** | Learning engagement sequence | Feedback, guidance, performance elicitation |
| **Bloom’s Taxonomy** | Cognitive domain development | Recall, apply, and evaluate math concepts |
| **Constructivism** | Active learner participation | Self-discovery through interactive solving |
| **Behaviorism** | Reinforcement learning | Visual and verbal rewards for correct answers |
| **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** | Accessibility and inclusivity | Multi-sensory feedback (visual + text) |

---

##  Learning Strategies Implemented

- **Scaffolding:** Gradual increase in complexity based on grade.  
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Motivational responses for each child’s attempt.  
- **Self-Evaluation:** “Am I Right?” button promotes self-checking.  
- **Repetition for Retention:** Continuous engagement ensures memory retention.  
- **Constructive Feedback:** Encourages learning from mistakes.

##  How to Reproduce the Game with AI Tools

> **Prompt to Recreate This Project:**
> 
> “Create a colorful, child-friendly interactive math game for kids. Include grade-wise questions, ‘Am I Right?’ button, shiny multicolored stars for correct answers, and a ‘Next Grade Challenge’ button. The interface must follow gamified instructional design principles (constructivism, formative assessment, behaviorist reinforcement) and use bright, accessible visuals, rounded corners, and motivational text feedback. Include score and timer functionality with responsive design.”
